<h2>Remembering Joe</h2>

<p>"I feel more blessed and fortunate than most people," says Joe Rosenblum.
And it's not hard to believe this. For Joe, in his tenth decade of
life, is a busy man and doesn't seem to be slowing down.
</p>

<p>My friend, Joe,
was born in Boston and attended schools there. He received a degree in
mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He has worked in a variety of engineering/technical positions, such as
a product engineer in cinematography (i.e. design and development of
photo equipment), project engineer for development of business
machines, and in charge of manufacturing plant layout for devices and
machinery for the Armed Forces during WWII. This latter position,
deemed an essential occupation for the war, got him a deferment
although he was 1A.
</p>

<p>
During the
second World War, while working for Remington-Rand, General Douglas
MacArthur was the CEO and Joe had a chance to meet him. "It was an
honor to shake his hand," says Joe. While working in Norwalk, CT, at
Olivetti, Joe played in the Norwalk Community Symphony Orchestra. The
orchestra had a distinguished list of professional artists, such as
Beverly Sills and Yo Yo Ma. Joe studied the violin at the age of
thirteen, and as a high school cadet he started as a drummer in the
marching band ("Not my cup of tea," he says). He also found a bugle and
bought a mouthpiece and joined the bugle corps. (In his high school, he
had compulsory military training.) He studied the clarinet and played
that in the band as well. But, since he had played the violin in junior
high, he ended by joining the high school orchestra, which gave him the
opportunity to play with the combined Boston high school orchestras.
During his long years in Boston he played in the Boston Civic
Orchestra, the WPA orchestra during WWII, and the "little symphony"
while he studied there. Obviously, Joe had found his niche in any
orchestra that he encountered or would be near in the future. Indeed,
he has been a member of the ICO since its inception in 2001. Prior to
that, he participated in the orchestra at the Community School for many
years.</p>

<p>Joe is a
widower. His wife was an attorney who gave up the law after they had
children. She and Joe were married for sixty-four years. He has three
sons, and two of Joe's brothers are twins, and he has twin grandsons.
He also has a great-grandson. When you are in Joe's house, there are
many photographs of family everywhere as you move around the main
rooms. Those of us who know Joe are aware of his visits to different
members of the family, for they love to have him near as those of us
here in Ithaca enjoy being in his company. If you open his appointment
book, the spaces are filled with notations for travels and for
concerts. As Joe says, "My calendar is full!"</p>

<p>For a man who
plays in two orchestras, attends lots of concerts, and travels
regularly, one might wonder how he has time to do anything else, but
Joe enjoys reading and television ("I watched Ted Koppel a lot, until
he retired, and I like Barbara Walters," says Joe). He likes news
programs, and gets his books from the library---some fiction,
biographies, and he likes the book sales that the Friends of the
Library have twice a year ("That's where I buy my books most of the
time," he says). He also attends theater productions at Cornell and
Ithaca College.</p>

<p>Wait, wait,
don't stop---Joe has been a lifelong volunteer since moving to Ithaca.
"I fell in love with Ithaca when I visited it," he says. Joe's
philosophy of life: "Keep busy and active at all times, doing the
things you like to do, and do the things you must do!" If you go past
Joe's house, you might find him mowing the lawn, or shoveling a bit of
snow ("I just make enough room for the tires and the bottom of the car
takes care of the rest"). So you know this is not a man sitting around
hoping for something to happen. He is a force that makes things happen,
a man who is important to the lives of not only his large family, but
to those of us who are lucky enough to say he is a friend.</p>
